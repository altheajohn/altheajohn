## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Althea (She/Her)

### My background in UX and Ops
Before Flatiron, I worked for Cozykin, a nanny startup that was acquired in 2020. I started as a nanny, and moved into a Care Manager in HQ. As a care manager, I did user experience research with our community of nannies, which we used to design a new nanny share management product to track childrenâ€™s daily activities and enable communication between nannies and parents. I was also the primary owner of a program we created called Backup Care, which provided on-call nannies to families whenever their assigned nanny called out.  I managed between 15-30 nannies at any given time, and created my own scheduling system using Airtable, Slack and Zapier.
